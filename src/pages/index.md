      ### Naturally gluten free   
      Beer doesn’t need gluten, so why use it? We brew exclusively with ingredients that are naturally gluten free so that everyone can enjoy our beers ([more info here](/faqs#gluten)).

      ### Climate-resilient brewing   
      Climate change is affecting agriculture worldwide, and the beer industry is no exception. Our recipes draw upon a wide range of crops, many of which are drought-resistant and can be adapted to our changing world.

      ### Ancient grains with big flavor   
      Beer is dominated by barley for historical reasons, but there are a lot of flavor reasons to explore other grains. From quinoa to millet to buckwheat and beyond, we bring you a unique and delicious taste experience.
